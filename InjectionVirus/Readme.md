## üìú Overview

This project demonstrates, in a **safe way**, how a command injection attack could be simulated and how to detect potential injection indicators in files.

The deliverables include:
- **`sim_injector.c`** ‚Äî Simulator showing how a malicious wrapper could inject arguments into a command.
- **`scan_injections.c`** ‚Äî Static detection scanner that searches for suspicious command-injection patterns in files within a directory.
- **Test files** for demonstration.
- **Screenshots** and **output logs** from program execution.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Note:**  
This project is strictly for educational purposes. No commands are actually executed, and the programs are safe to run in any environment.  
The simulation **only prints** what would happen ‚Äî nothing is run.  
The detection program **only reads** files and flags possible patterns.
